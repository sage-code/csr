      <description>A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be reusable and can be called from different parts of the program.&#xA;Evolution of Functions Functions have evolved in modern programming languages like Julia.&#xA;First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as values, meaning they can be: Assigned to variables Passed as arguments to other functions Returned from functions Higher-Order Functions: Functions that operate on other functions, enabling: Mapping (applying a function to each element of a collection) Filtering (selecting elements based on a condition) Reducing (combining elements using a function) Closures: Functions that capture variables from their enclosing scope, creating &amp;ldquo;stateful&amp;rdquo; functions that remember values across calls.</description>
