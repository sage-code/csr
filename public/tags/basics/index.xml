      <description>In this article we investigate several programming languages. We will understand the difference between them and we will try to explain why we have so many programming languages. Our favorite programming language is Julia. We will explain why and we will try to motivate you to learn multiple programming languages. We think a software engineer should know at least 3 programming languages.&#xA;What is a Programming Language? Here&amp;rsquo;s an explanation of programming languages, interpreters, and compilers:</description>

      <description>Pictograms, alphabets and numeric symbols are 3 important pillars of civilization.These three, have played a crucial role in the development and advancement of human civilization. Each pillar has had a profound impact on how we communicate, record information, and organize knowledge.&#xA;Pictograms: The earliest form of written communication, pictograms served as a way to visually represent objects, ideas, and events. They laid the foundation for the development of writing systems by establishing the principle of using symbols to convey meaning.</description>

      <description>Understanding expressions is fundamental to both computer science and programming. They&amp;rsquo;re the building blocks of code, allowing you to manipulate data, control program flow, and make decisions.&#xA;There are many types of expressions, each serving a specific purpose. Here are some of the most common ones:&#xA;1. Arithmetic Expressions: These expressions perform mathematical operations on numbers, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You might use them to calculate distances, areas, or any other numerical value needed in your program.</description>

      <description>Data structures are the way we organize and store information in memory. They are like containers that hold different types of data and provide efficient access, manipulation, and retrieval. Imagine a bookshelf: it organizes your books by genre or author, making it easier to find a specific book. Similarly, data structures organize data to be processed efficiently by algorithms.&#xA;Foundation Data structures are crucial for writing efficient and clean code. They determine how quickly you can search for data, insert new elements, or delete existing ones.</description>

      <description>Here is an explanation of object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm and principles, its advantages and disadvantages, and 3 top languages that are considered pure OOP:&#xA;OOP Principles Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects, which are self-contained entities that combine data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP principles are:&#xA;Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together within an object, protecting internal data from unauthorized access. Inheritance: Creating new classes (subclasses) based on existing classes (superclasses), inheriting their attributes and methods.</description>

      <title>Functions</title>

      <description>A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to be reusable and can be called from different parts of the program.&#xA;Evolution of Functions Functions have evolved in modern programming languages like Julia.&#xA;First-Class Functions: Functions are treated as values, meaning they can be: Assigned to variables Passed as arguments to other functions Returned from functions Higher-Order Functions: Functions that operate on other functions, enabling: Mapping (applying a function to each element of a collection) Filtering (selecting elements based on a condition) Reducing (combining elements using a function) Closures: Functions that capture variables from their enclosing scope, creating &amp;ldquo;stateful&amp;rdquo; functions that remember values across calls.</description>

      <description>Introduction Understanding UX/UI can feel overwhelming at first, but fret not! Here&amp;rsquo;s a breakdown of these closely intertwined concepts, along with a learning roadmap to kickstart your journey, from newbie to pro:&#xA;1. Decoding the Terms:&#xA;UX (User Experience): Imagine every interaction you have with a product, website, or app. The overall feeling, ease of use, and satisfaction â€“ that&amp;rsquo;s UX. A UX Designer aims to make these interactions smooth, intuitive, and enjoyable.</description>

      <description>In this short tutorial we introduce you to HTML fundamentals. This is good enough to get you started but eventually you will need an advanced course that we provide on our home site. This is a long page so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&#xA;What is HTML? HTML: HyperText Markup Language, aka the Blueprint for Awesome Websites&#xA;Hold your horses, HTML newbies! Before you start constructing digital masterpieces, let&amp;rsquo;s decode the mysterious acronym and uncover its true nature.</description>

      <description>Introduction Imagine a restaurant. When you sit down, you see the menu (front-end), the waiters taking your order (interaction), and the delicious food arriving (result). But what happens in the kitchen (back-end)? That&amp;rsquo;s where the magic happens!&#xA;Similarly, websites and apps also have two sides:&#xA;Front-End: This is what you see and interact with, like buttons, menus, and text. It&amp;rsquo;s like the restaurant&amp;rsquo;s dining area and interface. Back-End: This is the hidden part that makes everything work, like storing data, processing information, and connecting to databases.</description>
