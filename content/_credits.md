> **To content creators who embrace self-learning:** You're more than educators, you're explorers, igniting curiosity and guiding hands along uncharted paths. You crack open doors in knowledge walls, handing us shovels and showing us how to dig. Thank you for sharing your journeys, for making learning an adventure, and for reminding us that even the wisest explorer was once a wide-eyed beginner. Here's to the infinite horizons you help us discover! (Gemini Pro)
