# Interpreters

Code interpreters, are like live musicians. They take your code, read it line by line, and play it on the fly. They are great for quick tests and experimentation, but oh boy, can they be slow. Like that friend who stumbles through a karaoke ballad.

Two programmers are arguing:

* "Interpreters are the future!" one say.
* "Yeah, the future of slow computers!" the other says.
