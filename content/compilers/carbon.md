Carbon is still under development and lacks certain features like for loops and comparison operators like `<`. However, we can still achieve the Fibonacci sequence using other techniques. Here's one approach:

```carbon
fn Main() -> i32 {
  let mut number: i32 = -1
  let mut previousNumber: i32 = 1

  // Prompt user for input
  Print("Enter a positive integer: ")
  let input = ReadLine()

  // Convert input to i32
  let n = Try(input.Trim().Parse())

  // Handle potential parsing errors
  if n.IsError() {
    Print("Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer.")
    return 1
  }

  // Iterate n times with custom loop logic
  while n.Value() > 0 {
    // Calculate next number and update previous
    let nextNumber = number + previousNumber
    previousNumber = number
    number = nextNumber

    // Decrease iteration counter
    n.Value() -= 1
  }

  // Print the result
  Print("The nth Fibonacci number is {0}", number)
  return 0
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We initialize two variables, `number` and `previousNumber`, to hold the current and previous Fibonacci numbers.
* We prompt the user for an integer and read the input with `ReadLine()`.
* We use `Try` and `IsError` to safely convert the input to an `i32` and handle potential parsing errors.
* Since loops and comparisons are not yet available, we use a custom loop structure with `while` and decrementing the `n` value each iteration.
* Inside the loop, we calculate the next Fibonacci number (sum of previous two) and update the previous number.
* Finally, we print the nth Fibonacci number stored in `number`.

This implementation uses an iterative approach instead of recursion due to Carbon's current limitations. It demonstrates how to achieve the desired functionality despite the language's ongoing development.
