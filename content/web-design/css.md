## Fundamentals

I don't know if you are new to CSS Or not. I will try in this page to introduce the basic concepts using AI prompts. This may be not perfect or enaugh. At the end I will invite you to our advanced course. Here's a breakdown of CSS fundamentals:

**What is CSS?**

- **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) is a language used to style and format the visual presentation of HTML elements on a webpage.
- It controls the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of web content.

**Why Use CSS?**

- **Separation of concerns:** CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation, making code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain.
- **Consistency:** You can apply styles globally to multiple pages, ensuring a unified look and feel across your website.
- **Design flexibility:** CSS allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Selectors:**
   - Used to target specific HTML elements you want to style.
   - Types of selectors:
     - **Element selectors:** Target elements by their tag name (e.g., `h1`, `p`).
     - **Class selectors:** Target elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., `.container`, `.error`).
     - **ID selectors:** Target elements with a unique ID attribute (e.g., `#main-header`).

2. **Properties:**
   - Describe the visual characteristics you want to apply to selected elements.
   - Examples:
     - `color`: Sets the text color.
     - `font-size`: Sets the font size.
     - `background-color`: Sets the background color.
     - `text-align`: Aligns text horizontally.
     - `margin`: Sets the space around elements.
     - `padding`: Sets the space within elements.
     - `border`: Adds a border around elements.

3. **Values:**
   - Assign a specific value to each property to define the desired style.
   - Values can be:
     - Keywords (e.g., `bold`, `italic`)
     - Lengths (e.g., `10px`, `2em`)
     - Colors (e.g., `#FFFFFF`, `red`, `rgb(255, 0, 0)`)

4. **The Box Model:**
   - CSS represents each HTML element as a rectangular box with:
     - Content: The actual text or content within the element.
     - Padding: Space between the content and the border.
     - Border: A visible edge around the element.
     - Margin: Clear space around the element, outside the border.

5. **Specificity:**
   - CSS uses specificity rules to determine which styles apply when multiple rules target the same element.
   - More specific selectors override less specific ones.
   - IDs are more specific than classes, which are more specific than element selectors.

**Application:**

- CSS can be applied in three ways:
   - **Inline:** Within HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
   - **Internal:** Within the `<head>` of an HTML document using the `<style>` tag.
   - **External:** In a separate CSS file linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.

## Are you new to CSS?

Okay, don't worry! CSS isn't as scary as it might seem, especially coming from HTML. It's like adding makeup and clothes to your website to make it look beautiful. Here's a breakdown of the CSS syntax anatomy in the simplest way possible:

**Imagine you have a wardrobe for your website:**

* **Clothes:** These are the CSS styles like color, font, etc.
* **Hangers:** These are the selectors that tell which HTML element wears the styles.
* **Tags:** These are the curly braces and colons that hold everything together.

**Let's style a paragraph:**

1. **Hanger:** You pick the hanger, which could be the paragraph tag itself (`p`).
2. **Clothes:** You choose the clothes you want on the hanger, like a red shirt (`color: red`) and big sneakers (`font-size: 20px`).
3. **Tags:** You put the clothes on the hanger using curly braces (`{`) and separate each piece with a semicolon (;).

**So, the whole outfit looks like this:**

```css
p {
  color: red;
  font-size: 20px;
}
```

**Here are some other things to remember:**

* You can have multiple hangers (selectors) in one wardrobe (a CSS file).
* You can mix and match clothes (properties) on different hangers.
* There are different types of hangers (selectors) for different occasions:
    * IDs are like fancy name tags for specific elements (`#unique-id`).
    * Classes are like group labels for similar elements (`.special-group`).
* There are many more clothes (properties) in the store than just color and font!

**Tips for beginners:**

* Start small and practice styling one element at a time.
* Don't be afraid to experiment and play around.
* Use online resources and tutorials to learn more styles and techniques.
* Remember, CSS is just another tool to make your website awesome!

So, take a deep breath, put on your creativity hat, and start making your website look fantastic with CSS!

## CSS Selectors

**Here are common CSS selectors, explained with examples:**

**1. Element Selectors:**

* Target elements based on their HTML tag name.
* Example:
  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: 36px;
  }
  ```
  This styles all `<h1>` headings on the page with a font size of 36px.

**2. Class Selectors:**

* Target elements that have a specific class attribute.
* Use a dot (.) before the class name.
* Example:
  ```css
  .error {
    color: red;
  }
  ```
  This styles any element with the class "error" in red text.

**3. ID Selectors:**

* Target elements with a unique ID attribute.
* Use a hash (#) before the ID name.
* Example:
  ```css
  #main-header {
    background-color: blue;
  }
  ```
  This styles the element with the ID "main-header" with a blue background color.

**4. Universal Selector:**

* Targets all elements on the page.
* Use an asterisk (*).
* Example:
  ```css
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  ```
  This applies the `box-sizing: border-box` property to all elements.

**5. Combinator Selectors:**

* Target elements based on their relationship to other elements.
* Examples:
  - **Descendant Selector:** Selects elements that are descendants of another element.
    ```css
    div p {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```
    Styles all `<p>` elements inside any `<div>`.
  - **Child Selector:** Selects elements that are direct children of another element.
    ```css
    ul > li {
      list-style-type: none;
    }
    ```
    Styles only direct `<li>` children of `<ul>` elements.
  - **Adjacent Sibling Selector:** Selects an element that immediately follows another element.
    ```css
    h2 + p {
      margin-top: 0;
    }
    ```
    Removes the top margin from `<p>` elements that immediately follow `<h2>` elements.

**6. Attribute Selectors:**

* Target elements based on the presence or value of a specific attribute.
* Examples:
  ```css
  a[href="https://www.example.com"] {
    color: green;
  }
  ```
  Styles links with the href "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com)" in green.

**7. Pseudo-Class Selectors:**

* Target elements based on their state or behavior.
* Examples:
  - `:hover`: Targets elements when the mouse hovers over them.
  - `:active`: Targets elements when they are being activated (e.g., clicked).
  - `:focus`: Targets elements when they have focus (e.g., input fields).
  - `:first-child`, `:last-child`: Target the first or last child of a parent element.

**8. Pseudo-Element Selectors:**

* Target parts of elements that aren't actual HTML elements.
* Examples:
  - `::before`, `::after`: Generate content before or after an element.
  - `::first-line`: Styles the first line of text in an element.

## The Cascade

**Here's how the CSS cascade works to determine which styles are applied to an element:**

**1. Origin and Importance:**

- **Origin:** Styles come from different sources, each with a level of importance:
    - **Author styles:** Styles you create in external stylesheets, internal `<style>` tags, or inline `style` attributes.
    - **User styles:** Styles set by the user in their browser settings.
    - **User-agent styles:** Default styles provided by the browser.
- **Importance:** The `!important` rule can override other styles, even if they have a higher specificity.

**2. Specificity:**

- When multiple rules try to style the same element, the browser uses specificity to determine the winner:
    - **ID selectors (#) have the highest specificity.**
    - **Class selectors (.) have lower specificity.**
    - **Element selectors (e.g., h1, p) have the lowest specificity.**
    - More specific selectors override less specific ones.

**3. Order of Appearance:**

- If two rules have the same specificity, the one that appears later in the stylesheet takes precedence.

**4. Cascade Layers:**

- CSS now supports cascade layers, which allow you to create explicit priority levels within a stylesheet, even for rules with the same specificity.

**5. Inline Styles:**

- Inline styles (within the `style` attribute of an HTML element) have the highest priority, overriding all other styles.

**Here's a visual representation of the cascade:**

```
User styles (!important)
Author styles (!important)
Author styles
User-agent styles
```

**Key Points:**

- The cascade is a crucial mechanism for resolving potential conflicts between styles.
- Understanding specificity and origin is essential for writing efficient and predictable CSS.
- Cascade layers provide more granular control over style priority.
- Use `!important` sparingly, as it can make code harder to maintain.

    - Examples: `text-decoration: none;`, `text-decoration: underline;`, `text-decoration: line-through;`

**2. Background Properties:**

- **`background-color`:** Sets the background color.
    - Examples: `background-color: white;`, `background-color: #f0f0f0;`, `background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);`
- **`background-image`:** Sets an image as the background.
    - Example: `background-image: url('image.jpg');`
- **`background-repeat`:** Controls how the background image repeats.
    - Examples: `background-repeat: repeat;`, `background-repeat: no-repeat;`, `background-repeat: repeat-x;`

**3. Dimensions and Box Model:**

- **`width`:** Sets the width of an element.
    - Examples: `width: 200px;`, `width: 50%;`, `width: auto;`
- **`height`:** Sets the height of an element.
    - Examples: `height: 100px;`, `height: 30vh;`, `height: inherit;`
- **`margin`:** Sets the space around an element's exterior.

    - Examples: `padding: 20px;`, `padding-left: 15px;`

**4. Positioning and Layout:**

- **`display`:** Controls how an element is displayed.
    - Examples: `display: block;`, `display: inline;`, `display: none;`
- **`position`:** Sets the positioning method for an element.
    - Examples: `position: static;`, `position: relative;`, `position: absolute;`
- **`float`:** Floats an element to the left or right.
    - Examples: `float: left;`, `float: right;`

**5. Borders:**

- **`border`:** Sets a border around an element.
    - Examples: `border: 1px solid black;`, `border-top: 5px dashed red;`
- **`border-radius`:** Rounds the corners of an element.
    - Examples: `border-radius: 5px;`, `border-radius: 10px 5px;`

## States & Transitions

**I'll explain CSS element states and transitions:**

**Element States:**

- **Refer to different conditions or behaviors an element can exhibit** in response to user interactions or events.
- **Targeted using pseudo-classes** in CSS selectors.
- **Common states:**
    - `:hover`: When the mouse pointer hovers over an element.
    - `:active`: When an element is being activated (e.g., clicked).
    - `:focus`: When an element has focus (e.g., input fields).
    - `:visited`: Links that have been visited by the user.
    - `:checked`: Checkboxes or radio buttons that are checked.
    - `:disabled`: Disabled elements.
    - `:enabled`: Enabled elements.

**Example:**

```css
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

- This changes the link color to blue when the mouse hovers over it.

**CSS Transitions:**

- **Create smooth, animated changes between different styles** when a state change occurs.
- **Defined using the `transition` property**, specifying:
    - **Properties to animate:** `transition: property duration timing-function delay;`
    - **Duration:** Length of the transition (e.g., `2s`)
    - **Timing function:** Controls the speed curve of the animation (e.g., `ease-in-out`)
    - **Delay:** Optional delay before starting the transition

**Example:**

```css
button {
  background-color: blue;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease-in-out;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: green;
}
```

- This animates the button's background color from blue to green over 0.5 seconds when hovered over.

**Key Points:**

- Element states allow for dynamic styling based on user interactions.
- Transitions enhance user experience by creating visually appealing visual effects.
- Use transitions judiciously to avoid overwhelming users with too many animations.
- Consider accessibility when using transitions, as some users may have motion sensitivity.
