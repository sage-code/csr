## Send e-mail services

Sometimes you have a form where users can submit contacts and tickets. You want your data to be saved but also send notifications or confirmation e-mails. This is not a simple task to perform. There is a lot of work. A good idea is to use an e-mail third party service. They make money for this service. And is amazing how many people pay for it. Let's compare some services.

Here is a list of links in Markdown format for the requested services:

* [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/)
* [Resend](https://resend.com/)
* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
* [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/)
* [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/)

Here's a breakdown of the services you mentioned for sending automated form submission responses with confirmation links, focusing on free plans and their strengths:

**Free Plans and Considerations:**

* **Postmark:** Doesn't offer a true free plan, but has a 14-day trial with 25,000 emails. It excels in customer support and deliverability.
* **Resend:** Offers a free plan with limitations (typically a low monthly email limit). Check their website for specifics. It focuses on transactional emails and might not have a built-in confirmation link feature.
* **SendGrid:** Provides a free plan with 10,000 emails per month and limited features. It's a popular choice with a good balance of features and free tier generosity. 
* **AWS SES:** Requires an AWS account and has a free tier with limitations based on send volume and usage. It's a powerful tool but can be more complex to set up. 
* **MailChimp:** Free plan allows for 2,000 subscribers and 10,000 emails per month, but branding limitations might be present in free emails. It's good for basic marketing automation, but confirmation links might require additional setup.
